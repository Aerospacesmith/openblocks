OpenBlocks refactoring branch
=============================

This is a fork of MIT OpenBlocks (covered by the MIT license) for refactoring purposes.

The principal objective of the fork is to make the code more amenable to inclusion to other projects.

To do:
* use specific instances and contexts instead of static singletons
* move the code under the org.openblocks main package
